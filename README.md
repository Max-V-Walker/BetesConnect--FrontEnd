### User stories
### M.V.P
* As a user, I want to be able to post questions and have people reply to them so I can get a needed answer.
* As a user, I want to also be able to reply to other's posts so I can share my experiences and thoughts on their questions.
* As a user, I want to be able to bookmark someone's post so I can come back to it when I have the time and review user's responses.
* As a user, I want to be able to make my user profile a bit more personable so it's easier for people to feel more comfortable creating a conversation.
* * As a user I want to be able to view another user's profile so I can get to know them a bit.


### Stretch Goals
* As a user I want to be able to follow/unfollow users so if I like someone's posts, I'll see them on my home screen.
* As a user, I want to be able to message another user directly so I know the conversation is private and between us.
